This is a web application of the popular card game Blackjack that I created for my first-quarter project as part of Galvanize's full-stack web-development program.

For the unfamiliar, blackjack pits players against the "house" to see who can get closest to 21 points without going over. Numbered cards (2-10) are worth the same value, face cards (J, Q, K) are worth 10, and aces can be worth either 1 or 11 depending on what is the most beneficial. At the outset, each player is dealt two cards. The player plays first, and can choose to "hit", and draw another card, or "stay", and end their turn. The player can draw as many cards as they like, but loses if they exceed 21 points. If the player ends their turn without going over 21, or "busting", the dealer plays, and will draw cards until they either tie or exceed the players value, or bust.

I used HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and jQuery in this project, as well as the DeckOfCardsAPI (http://deckofcardsapi.com/).

To ensure the function tests included in the repo work properly, you will need to install mocha and chai, and run ```npm init``` inside the cloned repo on your local machine.

The deployed application can be found at http://p-glynn-q1-mvp.surge.sh/.

There are also a few screenshots included for your viewing pleasure.
